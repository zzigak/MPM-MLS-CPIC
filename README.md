# MLS-MPM-3D
**Authors:** Žiga Kovačič, Evan Zhang

This project was done as a final project for CS 5643 at Cornell University.

In this project we implemented the  Moving Least Squared Material Point Method both in 2D and 3D. We tried to document every part of the code so that it is understandable to novice MPM users.


To setup the environment, run:

```sh
uv sync
```


To run a python file simply run:

```sh
uv run <name>.py
```


## Project Structure


`mls-mpm.py` is one of the main files to look at. It implements MLS-MPM in 2D and 3D with marching squares in 2D.

`mpm-mls3D.py` is one of the main files and it generates few scenes, one of them being a jelly block falling onto a rigid Stanford Bunny mesh and extracts the jelly mesh at each timestep. You can use it to render in Blender.

`/results` folder holds a few of the results generated with our code.

`/demo` contains the code for generating demo videos

`demo.mp4`  shows the main videos generated by our code.

[Slides](slides.pdf) shows the final presentation slides for our project.

`marching_squares_2D.py` file demos our code for marching squares.
